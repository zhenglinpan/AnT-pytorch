# The Animation Transformer: Visual Correspondence via Segment Matching(ICCV2021)

This is an implementation of the paper [**The Animation Transformer: Visual Correspondence via Segment Matching(ICCV2021)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02614.pdf)

Albeit not finished, basic structures and the cores are done. 

This project is not aim to re-implement results demonstrated in the paper since the dataset is not made public. Despite that I'm trying my best to rewrite the codes introduced by the authors, **THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT**, but you're welcome to do modications on my code and sumbit and issues found.
